If you wouldn\u2019t go that deep without the Foil Boost, don\u2019t go that deep with it!<\/p><p><strong>Installation:<\/strong><\/p><ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"1\" style=\"list-style-type:1\"><li>Insert the small mast track cable guide into your board mast track and do up the grub screw to hold it in place. Don\u2019t need to overtighten this. Place it at the back if you are going to mount the receiver at the rear or the front if it\u2019s going to be mounted forward. From our conversation it sounded like you were riding a higher litre board, so I\u2019d try the back first to see if it works. Note that you will want to put the cable guide on the same side as the cable will come out of the main unit (the right side if the board is upside down).<\/li>\n\n<li>Place a couple of the rubber bands onto the top of your mast near the mast plate (optional, but they are great to run the cable under and keeps it even more tidy. An alternative is a small piece of tape or just leave the cable free).<\/li>\n\n<li>Determine the correct mast pads to use. You\u2019ll place the main unit about 12-15cm from the top of the mast and do it up first of all using the orange pads. If they are too small use the larger blue ones or if you can\u2019t do it up enough, change to the thinner grey ones. You might mix and match to get the ideal combination (eg. for my Axis carbon mast I use grey in the front and orange in the back). Note that there are front and back pads which are labelled. When doing up the mast clamp, you don\u2019t have to overtighten it, just do it up enough that it doesn\u2019t slide up or down with a bit of force applied. Trick to get the mast clamping plate on is to do the front bolt up about 1 turn, the do the back about one turn so they are both engaged, then tighten them each progressively. There are also alignment lines on the top of the unit near the front and back of the mast opening so that you can line up equally forward and back.<\/li>\n\n<li>Run the receiver cable up through the rubber bands and through the mast track cable guide.<\/li>\n\n<li>Place a stick on cable guide on the bottom of the board to hold the cable.<\/li>\n\n<li>Determine where you want to place the receiver (I\u2019d suggest directly behind the footpad across the board) and peel off the 3M adhesive backing to attach.<\/li>\n\n<li>If the cable is too long or short, remove the receiver from the board and unscrew the bottom of it. You can unwind or wind up cable inside it and then screw the bottom back on.<\/li>\n\n<li>You\u2019ll probably want to place another cable guide on top of the board to keep things neat.<\/li>\n\n<li>The process for mounting at the front is the same, however you\u2019ll probably want to use about 3 cable guides stuck on under the board.<\/li>\n\n<li>Remove the dust caps off the main unit and battery. Check there is no sand or grit on the battery o-ring seal. Apply some of the silicone lubricant if it\u2019s a bit dry (use the lubricant regularly, it\u2019ll make the o-ring last longer).&nbsp;<\/li>\n\n<li>Attach the battery. Note there is an alignment pin and markings on the sides. Make sure the single dashes are aligned and gently push the battery in. You\u2019ll see the indicator light on the top of the receiver come on flashing once it\u2019s inserted correctly. Do up the external locking ring. You\u2019ll want this one done up tight, not ridiculously tight, but definitely firm so that it doesn\u2019t come loose during use.<\/li>\n\n<li>Check the unit is correctly&nbsp;installed&nbsp;and there is nothing near the propeller (especially the receiver cable).<\/li>\n\n<li>Power on the remote. Check again the prop is clear. Press the trigger once to unlock (it\u2019ll lock again after 5 seconds of inactivity). Gently press the trigger and the motor will spin up.<\/li>\n\n<li>Attach the remote lanyard to your wing or paddle handle. Attach the rubber strap. I recommend using the circular one supplied with most wings as it just seems to work better, but you can try the rectangular one too on tighter hole settings if you like.<\/li><\/ol><figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Stoke Foil Boost - First Time Install\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/QmNeRk4xGTs?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure><p><strong>After the session riding and charging:<\/strong><\/p><p>After your session riding, give the prop a quick rinse with fresh water if you can and also give the remote trigger a quick rinse.<\/p><p>Always ensure the main unit is dry before removing the battery (keep an old towel in the car!). Unscrew the locking rings, remove the battery, check for and remove any sand or grit from either surface and then replace the dust caps onto the main unit and battery.<\/p><p>To charge the battery, it will take approx. 2 hours from flat. There is a light on top of the charger that will turn from red to green once charged. Once charged, disconnect from the charger, and like any Lithium Ion battery, don\u2019t leave it unattended while charging (you don\u2019t have to watch it, but don\u2019t go out for the day and leave it there!).<\/p><p>To charge the remote, place the flat side of the remote so that the diagonal line in the centre is located in the centre of the charger. Once you have it in the right place the ring around the outside of the charger will turn blue and the screen on the remote will indicate it\u2019s charging. It\u2019s a bit fiddly and some gentle downward pressure can sometimes help find the spot. I\u2019d suggest once you find it that you put tape on the charger to indicate where it goes next time. You will find that you don\u2019t have to charge the remote very often, probably once every 10 sessions.<\/p><p>Please call or email with any questions as you go through this process.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In this page you&#8217;ll find useful information for\u00a0installing\u00a0and maintaining your Stoke Foil Boost.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"template":"","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"rank_math_lock_modified_date":false,"footnotes":""},"class_list":["post-3257","help_centre","type-help_centre","status-publish","hentry","help_centre_category-installation"],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/help_centre\/3257","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/help_centre"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/help_centre"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"version-history":[{"count":13,"href":"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/help_centre\/3257\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":6603,"href":"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/help_centre\/3257\/revisions\/6603"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3257"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
