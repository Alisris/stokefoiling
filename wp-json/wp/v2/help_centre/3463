These cable guides are essential for securing the cables and maintaining the overall functionality of your foil board. To ensure a smooth replacement, purchasing a few spare cable guides and a spare mast track guide is a good idea! Here&#8217;s a step-by-step guide on how to replace these components:<\/p><p><strong>Step 1: Preparation<\/strong><\/p><p>Before you begin, ensure you have all the necessary materials and tools. Lay out your foil board on a clean, flat surface, and make sure it&#8217;s stable and won&#8217;t tip over during the process. Having spare cable and mast track guides nearby is a good precaution.<\/p><p><strong>Step 2: Removal of Old Cable Guides<\/strong><\/p><ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Start by carefully inspecting the old adhesive cable guides on your board. If they are damaged, peeling off, or no longer securely holding the cables, it&#8217;s time to replace them.<\/li>\n\n<li>Gently peel off the old cable guides. You can use your fingers or a screwdriver to lift the edges if they are stubborn. Be cautious not to damage the board&#8217;s surface while doing this.<\/li>\n\n<li>If any adhesive residue remains on the board after removing the old guides, use rubbing alcohol or acetone and a clean cloth or cotton ball to wipe it off. Ensure the surface is clean and dry before proceeding.<\/li><\/ol><p><strong>Step 3: Installing the New Cable Guides<\/strong><\/p><ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Take one of the spare adhesive cable guides and peel off the backing to expose the adhesive side.<\/li>\n\n<li>Carefully position the cable guide in the desired location on the foil board. Make sure it&#8217;s aligned properly, and firmly press it onto the board&#8217;s surface.<\/li>\n\n<li>Repeat this process for each cable guide you need to replace, ensuring they are all securely attached.<\/li><\/ol><p><strong>Step 4: Replacing the Mast Track Guide (if needed)<\/strong><\/p><p>If your spare mast track guide is needed, follow these additional steps:<\/p><ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Inspect the old mast track guide to see if it needs replacing. You&#8217;ll want to replace it if it&#8217;s damaged or no longer functioning correctly.<\/li>\n\n<li>Use a screwdriver to remove the screws holding the old mast track guide in place.<\/li>\n\n<li>Carefully take out the old mast track guide and replace it with the new one.<\/li>\n\n<li>Secure the new mast track guide in place by tightening the screws. Ensure it is snug but not over-tightened to avoid damaging the board.<\/li><\/ol><p><strong>Step 5: Final Inspection<\/strong><\/p><p>After replacing the adhesive cable guides and, if necessary, the mast track guide, inspect your foil board thoroughly. Make sure all components are securely attached and functioning as intended.<\/p><p>By following these steps and keeping spare components on hand, you&#8217;ll be well-prepared to maintain your Stoke Foil Boost board and keep it in optimal condition for your foiling fun!<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Replacing adhesive cable guides on the Stoke Foil Boost can be straightforward<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"template":"","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"rank_math_lock_modified_date":false,"footnotes":""},"class_list":["post-3463","help_centre","type-help_centre","status-publish","hentry","help_centre_category-using-the-stoke-foil-boost"],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/help_centre\/3463","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/help_centre"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/help_centre"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/help_centre\/3463\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3464,"href":"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/help_centre\/3463\/revisions\/3464"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3463"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
