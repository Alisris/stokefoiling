Choose a location with clear waters and a minimum depth of 1.5 metres to ensure your foil doesn&#8217;t encounter any obstacles. Equip yourself with the necessary safety gear, including an impact vest or personal flotation device and a helmet. Avoid surf zones with breaking waves when you\u2019re learning and steer clear of swimmers and other watercraft. Remember, don&#8217;t venture too far from shore. Plus, always check and adhere to local rules.<\/p><ol start=\"2\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Find your balance<\/li><\/ol><p>The easiest way to start is in a prone position. Begin with the power set to low, using the Stoke Foil Boost\u2019 bluetooth remote. Lower power is ideal for beginners and you can increase the power as you become more confident. When your board starts to rise, shift your weight forward. You can use your hands to help bring your weight forward.<\/p><p>Remember, more speed equals more lift, so you will need to move forward the faster you go. Grab the rails of your board and just like on a bodyboard try to turn by shifting your weight left or right. Experiment with turning and try to do some slow 180 degree turns.<\/p><ol start=\"3\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Onwards and upwards<\/li><\/ol><p>Once you&#8217;re comfortable in the prone position, gradually progress to kneeling. The next step is to stand. Unlike traditional surfing you don\u2019t need to stand up quickly. Take your time with the focus on stability.<\/p><p>The other thing that\u2019s different to surfing is you\u2019ll need more front foot pressure on a foil. It\u2019s a matter of finding that perfect balance point.&nbsp; Experiment with your surf stance. For some, it is easier to stand with two feet on either side of the board.&nbsp;<\/p><p>At the beginning, you don\u2019t want to engage your foil. Keep your weight forward riding on your board. Once comfortable, you can experiment with shifting your weight backwards and as soon as the foil engages, shifting your weight to the front again. This is often referred to as \u201ckangarooing\u201d. Once comfortable kangarooing try to level out your weight distribution while your foil is engaged.<\/p><ol start=\"4\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Learning to fall<\/li><\/ol><p>It\u2019s exciting learning to fly, but inevitably you will need to learn to fall as well. Knowing how to fall safely is essential. When you sense a loss of balance, don&#8217;t resist it. Instead, fall in the same direction as the board. Don\u2019t push off your board &#8211; aim to simply fall away from it. This approach reduces the chances of you falling toward the sharper wings of your foil.<\/p><ol start=\"5\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Getting up to speed<\/li><\/ol><p>Once you&#8217;re at ease cruising in a straight line, it&#8217;s time to experiment with your speed. Observe how your ride becomes smoother at higher speeds, but don\u2019t go too fast too soon. You can relish the excitement of foiling without necessarily reaching top speeds.&nbsp;<\/p><p>When it comes to speed, remember more speed equals more lift. So, you need to adjust your weight distribution accordingly.&nbsp;<\/p><ol start=\"6\" class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Move with it<\/li><\/ol><p>It\u2019s exciting foiling in a straight line, with the assistance of the Stoke Foil Boost, but now you\u2019re ready to change direction. Notice that even the subtlest body movements and shifts in balance can influence the foil. Use your body weight for gentle turns and continue to practise until you feel confident in controlling the board.&nbsp;<\/p><p>The higher you are on the mast, the less aggressive your turns can be. If you are leading your foil closer to the water surface, a sharper turn will result in foil breach and ventilation and ultimately loss of balance.<\/p><div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Take-flight-on-water-A-beginners-guide-to-foiling-with-the-Stoke-Foil-Boost-2.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Take-flight-on-water-A-beginners-guide-to-foiling-with-the-Stoke-Foil-Boost-2.jpg\" alt=\"Here are some tips on learning how to foil with the assistance of additional propulsion:\" class=\"wp-image-4402 lazyload\"\/><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"2240\" height=\"1260\" src=\"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Take-flight-on-water-A-beginners-guide-to-foiling-with-the-Stoke-Foil-Boost-2.jpg\" alt=\"Here are some tips on learning how to foil with the assistance of additional propulsion:\" class=\"wp-image-4402 lazyload\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Take-flight-on-water-A-beginners-guide-to-foiling-with-the-Stoke-Foil-Boost-2.jpg 2240w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Take-flight-on-water-A-beginners-guide-to-foiling-with-the-Stoke-Foil-Boost-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Take-flight-on-water-A-beginners-guide-to-foiling-with-the-Stoke-Foil-Boost-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Take-flight-on-water-A-beginners-guide-to-foiling-with-the-Stoke-Foil-Boost-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Take-flight-on-water-A-beginners-guide-to-foiling-with-the-Stoke-Foil-Boost-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Take-flight-on-water-A-beginners-guide-to-foiling-with-the-Stoke-Foil-Boost-2-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Take-flight-on-water-A-beginners-guide-to-foiling-with-the-Stoke-Foil-Boost-2-60x34.jpg 60w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Take-flight-on-water-A-beginners-guide-to-foiling-with-the-Stoke-Foil-Boost-2-110x62.jpg 110w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Take-flight-on-water-A-beginners-guide-to-foiling-with-the-Stoke-Foil-Boost-2-600x338.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2240px) 100vw, 2240px\" \/><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><\/div><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keep learning with the Stoke Foil Boost<\/h2><p>Once you\u2019ve experienced the thrill of flying while foiling, we\u2019re confident you\u2019ll be hooked.
