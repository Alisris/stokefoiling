However, we have designed our packs so they don&#8217;t &#8220;run dry&#8221;. Once the battery voltage gets down to about 10%, we reduce the power output to a lower level that would help get back to the beach but not enough to foil.<\/p><p>We then stop the power output before the battery is totally run dry to maximise the life of the batteries. Also, as you get towards the end of the battery pack, but before we reduce the power, you will notice a reduction in thrust available due to the decreased voltage from the almost flat battery and naturally want to come in and change to a fresh battery. So, all in all, Stoke is well protected against battery packs being run dry and shortening the life expectancy of the cells. We hope this helps!<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Our battery packs use the highest quality lithium-ion cells, so care, maintenance, and extended life recommendations will align with the usual lithium-ion battery instructions.
