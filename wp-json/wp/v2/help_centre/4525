This technique helps to stabilise the board as you begin the foiling process. Here are some other tips to consider:<\/p><ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Shift Weight for Takeoff:<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>As you pick up speed, smoothly shift your weight back to engage the foil. This weight transfer is crucial for lifting the board and transitioning into the foiling position. Allow the Stoke Foil Boost to build sufficient speed before initiating this weight shift for a controlled takeoff.<\/p><ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Timely Trigger Release:<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>To achieve a smooth foiling experience, release the trigger as soon as the unit is lifted out of the water. This action prevents unnecessary drag and allows the foil to elevate without resistance. Maintaining awareness of when the foil is in or out of the water is key to efficient foiling.<\/p><ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Re-Engage Motor for Speed and Stability:<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>If you notice a decrease in speed or disengagement of the foil, initiate the motor again. This technique helps regain speed and re-establish foil engagement. It&#8217;s essential to respond promptly to changes in speed to maintain control and stability during the foiling experience.<\/p><p>Remember, mastering these foiling techniques with the Stoke Foil Boost may take some practice. As you gain experience, you&#8217;ll refine these techniques and enhance your overall foiling skills!<\/p><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Maximising battery life while riding and throttle usage<\/h3><p>To extend the battery life of your Stoke Foil Boost and make the most of your riding experience, consider implementing the following techniques:<\/p><ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Paddle Assist Mode for Paddling Out:<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>When paddling out to catch waves, utilise the paddle assist mode, the lowest setting on the remote. This mode provides minimal power assistance, conserving battery life while allowing you to navigate the water easily.<\/p><ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Keep Boosts Short:<\/li><\/ul><p>Optimise your boosts by keeping them as short as possible. In many instances, achieving the desired speed doesn&#8217;t require the full 10 seconds of boost. Utilise shorter bursts of power to conserve energy and prolong battery life.<\/p><ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Use the Lowest Power Setting:<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>To maximise efficiency, operate the Stoke Foil Boost at the lowest power setting suitable for your current riding conditions. Lower power settings consume less energy, resulting in a longer-lasting battery during your session.<\/p><ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Strategic Trigger Usage:<\/strong><\/li><\/ul><p>The actuated trigger on the remote allows you to control the power you receive. Pull the trigger only to the extent necessary to engage your foil and reach your desired speed. Avoid unnecessary full pulls to conserve battery power and promote efficient usage.<\/p><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Remote control usage tips:<\/h3><p>It is essential to secure your remote control on your wrist, paddle, or wing handle, as the remote does not float. Securing it to your gear ensures it stays within reach and doesn&#8217;t get lost in the water.<\/p><ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Pull the trigger twice to engage the Stoke Foil Boost motor. The double pull is a safety feature, preventing accidental engagement and allowing you deliberate control over the motor activation.<\/li>\n\n<li>After the first trigger pull, you will feel a vibration from the remote. This vibration indicates that the motor is ready to be engaged. It&#8217;s a tactile feedback mechanism to inform you that the Stoke Foil Boost is prepared for your next action.<\/li>\n\n<li>The remote features an actuated trigger, meaning that the more you pull the trigger, the more power the motor delivers. This design allows for precise control over the amount of power applied, allowing you to tailor the motor&#8217;s output according to your riding preferences and conditions.<\/li><\/ol><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Changing power levels via the remote<\/h3><p>To adjust the power setting on the Stoke Foil Boost, locate the button with three dots on the remote control. This button is the control point for changing the power levels. Follow these steps:<\/p><ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Press the button with three dots, and the digital screen on the remote will display the power setting you are currently on. This allows you to visually confirm the existing setting before making any adjustments.<\/li>\n\n<li>Navigate through the available power settings until you reach the desired level. The three-dot button typically functions as a selector to cycle through different power options.<\/li>\n\n<li>Once you&#8217;ve chosen the desired power level, pull the trigger twice to engage the motor at the selected setting. The double trigger pull is a safety measure to confirm your intention and activate the Stoke Foil Boost at the specified power level.<\/li><\/ol><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Using the paddle assist mode&nbsp;<\/h3><p>Start by putting the remote on the first and lowest setting to activate paddle assist mode on the Stoke Foil Boost. This sets the system to a minimal power level, allowing you to seamlessly integrate paddling assistance into your ride.<\/p><p>Once the remote is on the lowest setting, paddle normally. The Stoke Foil Boost is designed to assist while paddling, enhancing your efficiency in navigating the water. Paddling with the motor engaged in paddle assist mode not only aids in maneuverability but also contributes to improved battery efficiency. The system assists your paddling efforts, reducing the strain on the battery and conserving energy for when you need additional power.<\/p><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Charging the battery and controller<\/h3><p>Disconnect the battery from the main unit or remove protective coverings before charging it. Ensure that both the battery and surrounding areas are clean and dry to promote a safe and efficient charging process, then follow these steps:<\/p><ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Connect the charger to the battery. Make sure the connection is secure to facilitate a stable and reliable charging process.<\/li>\n\n<li>Plug the charger into a socket. Confirm that the charger box displays a red light, indicating the charging process has commenced.<\/li>\n\n<li>While charging, the charger box will show a red light. Keep an eye on this indicator. The charging process continues until the light turns green, signifying the battery is fully charged.<\/li>\n\n<li>Once the green light appears, it indicates that the charging is complete. Disconnect the charger from the socket and disconnect the battery from the charger.<\/li>\n\n<li>After disconnecting, double-check the battery level to ensure it has reached the desired charge. Press the black button on the battery, and LED lights will illuminate, indicating the percentage charge level.<\/li><\/ol>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Applying more forward foot pressure when initiating the motor and aiming to keep the board flat on the water.
