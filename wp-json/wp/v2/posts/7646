With Prone Foiling, we&#8217;re catching even the smallest swells and accessing those elusive, deserted sandbars that are nothing but a tease on your shortboard. We love surfing, but when there is marginal surf, we want a solution that keeps us out on the water.<\/p><p>We&#8217;ll be honest with you right at the top; making the switch from traditional surfing to prone foiling isn\u2019t a walk in the park. We were humbled quickly the first time any of us paddled out with our foil. With a steep learning curve and not much guidance online for those of us who prefer paddling over kite or wing foiling, it\u2019s easy to feel like you\u2019re out there on your own.<\/p><p>So, to help our surf-loving boarders, here&#8217;s a list of tips we wish someone had handed us before making the leap from surfing to prone foiling. Make the most of those off-season conditions and expand your surfing horizons by getting your pump on!<\/p><figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Incredible prone foiling with the Stoke Foil Boost | Stoke #FoilMore\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/G5FTGemVK5U?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">No matter how seasoned a surfer you are, you\u2019re going to feel like a beginner again<\/h2><p>No matter how long you&#8217;ve been surfing, foiling is a very different sensation, so you\u2019re bound to take a few tumbles. Probably more than a few. Don\u2019t be surprised if you order a helmet after that first session, just in case the foil decides to get up close and personal during one of these falls. The key here is persistence. The learning curve might be steep, but you&#8217;ll be hooked once you catch that first smooth, effortless glide.<\/p><p>Choosing the right gear is important. The market is flooded with options, but our main piece of advice is not to overpower yourself. You don\u2019t want a wing that lifts you out of the water too quickly before you\u2019ve got a handle on things. Start with a mid-aspect foil for low-speed lift.<\/p><p>Foiling requires some patience. Unlike surfing, where you might catch a wave within minutes of paddling out, foiling demands time to master the fundamentals. You&#8217;ll need time to get comfortable with the sensation of gliding just above the water. Focus on controlling your lift and maintaining balance.&nbsp;<\/p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Understanding the importance of mast placement<\/h2><p>This might sound like a small detail, but it makes a massive difference. The position of the mast in the box affects how the foil behaves on the water. Generally, moving the mast forward will increase the lift, making it easier to get up and stay on the foil.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Low-aspect foils might perform better with the mast further back, especially during the learning phase. If the mast is too far forward with these foils, you might get too much lift too quickly, making it challenging to maintain balance as you get to your feet. Bring a key to the water to experiment with different placements and find what works best for you.<\/p><figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe title=\"Stoke Foil Boost - Prone Surf Foiling\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ptTawIRaRIg?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe>\n<\/div><\/figure><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mastering your wave selection<\/h2><p>When you\u2019re used to traditional surfing, your instincts might push you towards the biggest and most powerful waves. But for prone foiling, the perfect wave is essentially the opposite. You\u2019ll want to look for smaller, 1-2 foot waves that are super crumbly and barely breaking. These waves are typically less exciting from a surfing perspective but are ideal for learning to foil.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Steep, pitching waves are best avoided until you\u2019re more comfortable on the foil. Also, try to resist the temptation to paddle in at the steepest part of the wave; instead, take off from the shoulder or even the whitewater to give yourself a smoother start.<\/p><p>Remember, you can\u2019t pearl on a foil the way you can on a traditional board. In surfing, you\u2019re always mindful of not getting your weight too far forward to avoid nosedives. With foiling, it\u2019s actually beneficial to shift your chest forward a bit while paddling in. This helps keep the foil in the water as you transition to your feet. Starting with a broken wave is easiest, as you can slow down your pop-up. Having the upper body facing the direction of travel helps with stability &#8211; basically, you&#8217;ll want to imagine you are hugging a bear!<\/p><p>Once you\u2019re standing, focus on keeping your weight on your front leg until you\u2019re confident you have control and the foil isn\u2019t going to breach. This adjustment can be tricky for surfers used to riding off the back foot, but it\u2019s crucial for smooth foiling.&nbsp;<\/p><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">In prone foiling, simplicity is key<\/h2><p>When first starting out, avoid angling your takeoff or charging aggressively down the line. Experienced surfers often do this instinctively, but it\u2019s better to keep things straightforward when you&#8217;re learning to foil. Angle your board less and maintain a centred stance over your front foot. Focus on looking straight ahead and pulling a straight-hand approach until you feel comfortable and in control of the foil. Keeping your weight centred and avoiding sharp turns will help prevent the foil from breaching and make for a smoother learning curve.<\/p><p>Pumping is another area where you&#8217;ll see a significant shift from traditional surfing. While surfing involves pushing down with your front foot to drive through weak sections, foiling is more about the subtle art of unweighting your back foot. This technique allows the foil to rise and fall in a dolphin-like motion. Keep the board parallel to the water as you pump, and avoid any downward push with your front foot. Instead, focus on lifting your back foot and using gravity to guide you. Over time, this will help you master the rhythm of pumping and make the most of your foiling experience.<\/p><p>When falling, don&#8217;t kick your board or push off from it; fall in the direction that you lose balance. Don&#8217;t try to counteract the roll of the foil &#8211; if it was unintentional, fall off in the same direction to avoid landing on your foil.<\/p><div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/D002_C007_20130121_P00000-1.00_00_26_12.Still005.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/D002_C007_20130121_P00000-1.00_00_26_12.Still005-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"Prone foil more with the Stoke Foil Boost\" class=\"wp-image-6947 lazyload\"\/><noscript><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/D002_C007_20130121_P00000-1.00_00_26_12.Still005-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"Prone foil more with the Stoke Foil Boost\" class=\"wp-image-6947 lazyload\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/D002_C007_20130121_P00000-1.00_00_26_12.Still005-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/D002_C007_20130121_P00000-1.00_00_26_12.Still005-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/D002_C007_20130121_P00000-1.00_00_26_12.Still005-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/D002_C007_20130121_P00000-1.00_00_26_12.Still005-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/D002_C007_20130121_P00000-1.00_00_26_12.Still005-60x34.jpg 60w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/D002_C007_20130121_P00000-1.00_00_26_12.Still005-600x338.jpg 600w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/08\/D002_C007_20130121_P00000-1.00_00_26_12.Still005.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><\/div><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Prone foil more with the Stoke Foil Boost<\/h3><p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/product\/complete-kit-black\/\">Stoke Foil Boost<\/a> is an innovative electric propulsion system designed to get you foiling more.
