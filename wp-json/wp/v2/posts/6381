Instead, you\u2019re staring at your packed-away dinghy, hoping that the wind picks up before it gets too late in the day. We\u2019ve all faced this at one point, and there\u2019s never really been a proper solution. We\u2019re at the mercy of the weather gods.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Now though, that\u2019s all about to change.&nbsp;<\/p><!--more--><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Evolution of Foiling Dinghies<\/h2><p>Foiling dinghies have revolutionised the sailing experience, bringing a new level of excitement and speed to the sport. Boats like the Skeeta and WASZP have been at the forefront of this revolution, offering sailors the ability to soar above the water with ease and precision. But even these advanced foiling dinghies have their limits when it comes to low wind conditions.<\/p><p>The WASZP, known for its lightweight design and impressive performance, has been a favourite among dinghy foilers looking to break free from traditional sailing limitations. Similarly, the Skeeta, with its exciting performance and robust design, has opened the doors to foiling for a broader audience. Yet both of these boats can be held back by one common factor: insufficient wind to get up onto the foil.<\/p><div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/068A2004.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/068A2004.jpg\" alt=\"The Evolution of Foiling Dinghies\" class=\"wp-image-6394 lazyload\"\/><noscript><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1366\" src=\"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/068A2004.jpg\" alt=\"The Evolution of Foiling Dinghies\" class=\"wp-image-6394 lazyload\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/068A2004.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/068A2004-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/068A2004-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/068A2004-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/068A2004-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/068A2004-60x40.jpg 60w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/068A2004-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" \/><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><\/div><h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Introducing the Stoke Foil Boost<\/h2><p>This is where the Stoke Foil Boost comes into play. The Stoke Foil Boost is an electric propulsion system designed to attach seamlessly to your foiling dinghy, whether it&#8217;s a Skeeta, WASZP, or another brand. This innovative system allows you to foil in winds as light as 5 knots, plus offering enhanced manoeuvrability and extended time on the water. It\u2019s the perfect upgrade for sailors of all types, from beginners getting up for the first time to Olympic hopefuls wanting to maximise their training days.&nbsp;<\/p><div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_3229.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_3229.jpg\" alt=\"Introducing the Stoke Foil Boost on a foiling dinghy \" class=\"wp-image-6393 lazyload\"\/><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_3229.jpg\" alt=\"Introducing the Stoke Foil Boost on a foiling dinghy \" class=\"wp-image-6393 lazyload\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_3229.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_3229-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_3229-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_3229-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_3229-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_3229-60x40.jpg 60w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/IMG_3229-600x400.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" \/><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><\/div><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enhanced Performance<\/h3><p>One of the standout features of the Stoke Foil Boost is its ability to provide an easier start with improved control. This means you can enjoy the thrill of foiling without the frustration of waiting for the perfect wind conditions. WASZP\u2019s own founder Andrew \u201cAmac\u201d McDougall, had the opportunity to test the Stoke Foil Boost and shared his experience:<\/p><p>&#8220;It\u2019s pretty amazing, actually. There were a lot of times out there where I just wouldn\u2019t have got up at all (without the Boost), and it just gives you a little bit of go and then you\u2019re off. It\u2019s going to be really useful when the wind\u2019s at a constant 7 or 8 knots, maybe even 6 knots and you\u2019re not getting any gusts.&#8221;<\/p><p>\u201cIt was incredible to be able to foil in 5 knots of wind,&#8221; said David French, owner of Skeeta. \u201cJust to have the boost give you that extra oomph you need, once you\u2019re up and foiling your sail takes over. You could almost foil in no wind! It&#8217;s the perfect combination.\u201d<\/p><figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/068A2127.jpg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/07\/068A2127.jpg\" alt=\"Enhanced Performance using the Stoke Foil Boost on a foiling dinghy\n\" class=\"wp-image-6389 lazyload\"\/><\/a><\/figure><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Easy Integration<\/h3><p>Another significant advantage of the Stoke Foil Boost is its easy integration with existing dinghy setups. Designed for quick attachment, the Boost can be installed in just one minute, allowing you to spend less time preparing and more time foiling. Whether you&#8217;re using a Skeeta, WASZP, or any other foiling dinghy, the Stoke Foil Boost fits seamlessly, ensuring compatibility and convenience.<\/p><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">New Possibilities<\/h3><p>With the Stoke Foil Boost, sailors of all ages and sizes can get out on the water. You can explore new dimensions of sailing, venturing out even when the wind conditions aren&#8217;t ideal. This maximises your time on the water and reduces the amount of hard work those light wind days can be.<\/p><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Less Pumping<\/h3><p>The propulsion from the Stoke Foil Boost also reduces the need for pumping to get foiling. This means you\u2019re not exhausted as soon as you get going on the foiling dinghy!<\/p><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Versatility Across Brands<\/h3><p>The beauty of the Stoke Foil Boost lies in its versatility.
