At just over 2cm in width and height below the board, it&#8217;s sleek and compact. You\u2019ll hardly even notice it\u2019s there. The cable is just 2.8mm in diameter, so there won&#8217;t be any worries about hydrodynamic impacts or needing to slap on extra tape to your mast. Our custom-designed thin rubber bands keep the cable nice and tidy (similar to our top-of-board receiver).&nbsp;<\/p><p>If you\u2019re a seasoned pro or using a lower-volume board, the underboard receiver opens up some new possibilities. Since the entire board becomes an antenna, all you need is the tip of your nose poking out of the water to maintain perfect communication.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Important note: While the underboard antenna is a champ on most boards, a carbon mast track is better suited to our overboard receiver. Our team is on hand to steer you in the right direction if you are unsure which option best suits your set-up.<\/p><figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/Undeboard-Stoke-Foil-Boost.jpeg\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image\/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP\/\/\/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" data-src=\"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/Undeboard-Stoke-Foil-Boost.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6071 lazyload\"\/><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/Undeboard-Stoke-Foil-Boost.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6071 lazyload\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/Undeboard-Stoke-Foil-Boost.jpeg 1280w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/Undeboard-Stoke-Foil-Boost-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/Undeboard-Stoke-Foil-Boost-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/Undeboard-Stoke-Foil-Boost-768x512.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/Undeboard-Stoke-Foil-Boost-60x40.jpeg 60w, https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/06\/Undeboard-Stoke-Foil-Boost-600x400.jpeg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" \/><\/noscript><\/a><\/figure><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get the best connection possible<\/h3><p>While your board stays clean and clutter-free, with no cables cluttering up the top, the underboard receiver&#8217;s stable, consistent connection between the receiver and controller is the main thing keeping you on your groove.
