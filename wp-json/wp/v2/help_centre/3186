This presents an ideal opportunity to clean and ensure there are no signs of defects or wear and tear that could lead to problems in the future.&nbsp;<\/p><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rinsing with fresh water after use&nbsp;<\/h3><p>Saltwater and sand can take their toll on your equipment, so we recommend rinsing your Stoke products with fresh water after use. This will include periodic rinsing of the propeller blades and mast clamp bolts to ensure your Stoke Foil Boost remains in excellent condition.<\/p><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keep battery seal free from sand and debris<\/h3><p>Ensuring that the battery, internal cavity of the box, and power connector are dry and sand-free is important, as moisture can corrode electronic components and connections over time, leading to malfunction or permanent damage. Sand can cause abrasion and potentially short-circuit sensitive parts. Check these sections after each use, flush and dry with a clean towel.<\/p><h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Battery care and storage&nbsp;<\/h3><p>It&#8217;s important to note that lithium batteries are not compatible with prolonged full charges. Leaving them fully charged for extended periods, such as weeks or longer, can significantly decrease their lifespan and performance. This outcome is primarily due to the inherent nature of battery chemistry rather than any product quality issue.<\/p><p>For optimal results, we strongly recommend charging the battery on the same day you plan to use it or, at the very least, the night before. Ideally, batteries should be stored with a charge level between 40% and 60%.<\/p><p>Beware of using cheap 110v-240v inverters and generators without a pure sine wave output, as they can potentially harm your charging equipment. Like laptops or TVs, these chargers require a high-quality power source to function at their peak and prevent damage. For this reason, we strongly discourage using anything other than a pure sine wave inverter (110v-240v) or conventional mains power protected by a Residual Current Device (RCD).<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We recommend regularly inspecting all your equipment thoroughly.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"template":"","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"rank_math_lock_modified_date":false,"footnotes":""},"class_list":["post-3186","help_centre","type-help_centre","status-publish","hentry","help_centre_category-care-and-maintenance"],"acf":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/help_centre\/3186","targetHints":{"allow":["GET"]}}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/help_centre"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/help_centre"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/help_centre\/3186\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":3226,"href":"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/help_centre\/3186\/revisions\/3226"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.stokefoiling.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3186"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
